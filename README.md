Technologies used:
ReactJS (React hooks),
CSS (SASS),
HTML

This is the main version of the test task.

Also I created the second version where I used local files for video banner.
You can find it 
[HERE](https://nanccyy.github.io/mileage__local/).
This is a "critical" page in case Youtube api cannot be reached or the address of video changes, or YouTube stops broadcasting videos, etc. 
Code which differs from the first version is [HERE](https://github.com/nanccyy/mileage__local/blob/local/src/components/Banner/Banner.jsx);
